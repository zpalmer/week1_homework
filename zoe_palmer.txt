Hoping to get a good working knowledge of Ruby and a solid base for future learning! I also really like programming, so I’m hoping to have fun getting back into it.
Current Occupation: Tech Support
Interesting fact: I practice archery (originally, my dad taught me in our back yard…now that I don’t have a back yard, I go to a range :D)
